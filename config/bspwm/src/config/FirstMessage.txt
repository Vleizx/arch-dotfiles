    - (Super + Enter) Opens the terminal
    - (Super + q) To close windows/apps.
    - (Super + Space bar) Opens the apps menu
    - (Alt + Space bar) Open the menu to change the theme

Please check the menu of all keyboard shortcuts by pressing "Alt + F1" or directly by looking at the file ~/.config/bspwm/sxhkdrc from this file you can create your own keyboard shortcuts or modify the existing ones.
